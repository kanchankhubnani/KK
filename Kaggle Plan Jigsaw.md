# Kaggle Plan

## Notes:
1. Set some timelines
	1. Guideline - 2 hours per day ~ 1 week - one problem
2. Start with worst solutions 
	1. Base solution
3. Iterate and improve accuracy 

## Stage wise Execution:
Stage 1: Submit one solution (log reg)
Stage 2: Feature Engineering
Stage 3: All Models (Linear,logistics,Random Forest,Decision tree,Navie Bayes, SVM,Adaboost)
